    * Reichskommissariat Belgien-Nordfrankreich - ex. Belgium

* France’s national focus tree clean up & rework. From now on France can decide between “Form the Popular Front” & “Revive the National Bloc” (w/o meme focuses tho)
* France’s focuses from “Devalue the Franc” branch now cost 2 times less (35 days instead of 70), but “Support the Grandes Ecoles” & “Form the National Research Center” are still the same (70 days to complete)
