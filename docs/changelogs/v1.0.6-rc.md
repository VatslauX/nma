# General
* There is no more local construction build penalty on ex-china warlords states (was -90% penalty)
* Airzones over USSR are now back to their vanilla state (were merged in to one airzone starting from ural mountains and to the far east)
# Features
* Introduced a new game rule which can slow down USA's refineries construction speed by 200% up to 1st January of 1943
# Optimizations
* Every possible african non-existing country (such as Syria, Algeria, etc) were removed and replaced by single 
 "United African States" country, which drastically decreases lags during the game.
# Bugfix
* Anti-grind missions algorithm improvement: AI now will disband it's divisions if it's being overgrinded.
* Triumph in Africa focus is no longer possible to be bypassed
* Yet another division veterancy fix
* UK now can't be instantly captured during the forming of Franco-British Union (paradox please fix). New UK's national spirit fixes that. In order to remove this national spirit UK should lost Gibraltar, Cairo (state) and Sinai (state)
* Collaboration government mission cost multiplier set to 0 (which prevent the cost of this mission to raise with each execution)
