## Bugfix
* GEACPS creation collaboration government sharing fix
* Japan war escalation mission fix (now it starts if only the sino-japanese war has started)
* GER and SOV now get more vanilla but still main model targeted tanks discounts

## Improvements
* Control trade spy mission and associated upgrade were removed due to the fact it might crash the savegame file
* Diplomatic pressure spy mission was removed because it's useless
* New AI strategy introduced to force SWE, TUR and POR to build infrastructure in resource states, stay on free trade and develop construction and excavation technologies
