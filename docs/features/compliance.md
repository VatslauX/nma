## Disclaimer

Let’s face the common truth: Paradox didn’t care about multiplayer HoI IV and since the introduction of new Compliance & Espionage system Axis countries were so heavily nerfed, that multiplayer on vanilla couldn’t be taken seriously.

Our first goal was to make this system playable, rewardable & team based (basically what Paradox should have done).

## What have we done to achieve that?

1. You don’t need to pay factories for agency creation. This process is now instant and completely free.
1. Agency upgrades are now 2 times cheaper.
1. You don’t need to upgrade your agency to become the spymaster anymore.
1. Intel Network presence now reduces max planning factor only for 10% (was 100% at 100% intel network strength)
1. Faction leaders (ENG/GER/SOV/JAP) are now considered as their faction’s Spymaster by default. (JAP will become a Spymaster of his faction after completing “GEACPS” focus). Any faction member can ask his faction leader to take over the spymaster role via vanilla’s default diplomatic option “Take over spymaster”.
1. Puppets now have opportunity to become a Spymaster
1. Every operation phase (except blueprint stealing related) which requires civilian factories will now cost only 1 civilian factory (previously was 3-5-10, depends on the phase)
1. <span class="text-green-000">“Prepare collaboration government”</span> mission now will always give 40% of compliance
1. If <span class="text-green-000">Spymaster</span> has completed the <span class="text-green-000">Prepare collaboration government</span> mission successfully - <span class="text-green-000">every member</span> of his faction <span class="text-green-000">will be granted with 40% of compliance</span> in the desired country.
1. If <span class="text-green-000">any non-spymaster</span> country has completed the <span class="text-green-000">“Prepare collaboration government”</span> mission successfully - <span class="text-green-000">every member</span> of his faction <span class="text-green-000">will be granted only with 20% of compliance</span> in the desired country, but the <span class="text-green-000">country who executed</span> the <span class="text-green-000">“Prepare collaboration government”</span> mission successfully <span class="text-green-000">will be granted with 40%</span> of compliance anyway.
1. Collaboration now is <span class="text-green-000">fully shareable</span> among the faction members. If you're joining a faction then <span class="text-green-000">50% of your existing collaboration</span> will be shared among every faction member.
1. Any <span class="text-green-000">new faction member</span> will be granted with the <span class="text-green-000">faction's spymaster’s amount of compliance</span> in corresponding states.
1. All fascist countries now have access to modifier versions of "Harsh Quotas", "Forced Labor", "Brutal Oppression" occupation laws. These versions don't have compliance decay. 
1. <span class="text-green-000">“Root out resistance”</span> mission now also gives <span class="text-green-000">0.02</span> compliance daily (~7% per year)
1. Compliance decay reduced to 0.081 (was 0.083) at maximum amount of compliance. (Compliance decay now 25% less overall)
1. Changing state owner now reduces compliance by 30% (was 50%)
1. Collaboration government mission cost multiplier set to 0 (which prevent the cost of this mission to raise with each execution)
1. <span class="text-green-000">“Prepare collaboration government”</span> mission now goes for <span class="text-green-000">75 days</span> (was 90)
1. Preparation phase in collaboration mission (that phase which consumes your factories) now goes for <span class="text-green-000">21 days</span> (was 60)
1. Japan will be granted with 70% of compliance over French Indochina as soon as France will transfer these territories to Japan.
1. If Franco-British union was made ENG will be granted with 70% of compliance in every ex-french state.
1. German focus “Form the Reichskommissariats” has been restored & reworked. Decisions from this focus will now set 80% of compliance on the corresponding CORE territories:
    1. Reichskommissariat Norwegen - ex. Denmark (European part) & Norway
    1. Reichskommissariat Niederlande - ex. Netherlands (European part)
    1. Reichskommissariat Belgien-Nordfrankreich - ex. Belgium (European part)
    1. Reichskommissariat Ostland - ex. Latvia, ex. Estonia, ex. Lithuania

## Conclusion

All those changes are making the Compliance & Espionage system way more playable & enjoyable in general. Now Axis should distribute collaboration missions between the alliance and if something went wrong they can always use operative to passively gain compliance. Additionally due to the changes in compliance decay rate & occupation laws sustaining a decent amount of compliance during the war is way more easier.
