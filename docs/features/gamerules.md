## Additional lobby rules

As the title says. We know that we’ve a lot of different hosts and communities who’re playing in HoI IV, so instead of <span class="text-green-000">hardcoding</span> some very <span class="text-green-000">sensitive</span> gameplay questions we’ve made an additional menu in lobby settings where the host can set up a lobby however he wants. 

Unfortunately we can’t give an opportunity to set literally <span class="text-green-000">every game aspect</span> in the lobby options. The reason why we can’t do so is the game’s internal structure. For instance, such things like history files (which contain resource allocations, starting units, etc) can’t be modified in this way and the same goes for defines.

<span class="text-green-000 fw-500">To set lobby rules all you need to do is to click here, while hosting:</span>
<div class="d-flex flex-justify-around">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/custom_game_rules.jpg" />
</div>

<span class="text-green-000 fw-500">Right now host can set next things:</span>

## NMA Multiplayer - Grinding Options


Additionally we’ve introduced a completely new QoL feature: host could limit (in months) for how long players can grind each country

<div class="d-flex flex-justify-around">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/custom_game_rules_window_4.jpg" />
</div>

You can turn off this feature just by having “no limits” for each corresponding country, but if you want to turn it on you should choose for how long players would be able to grind each country
