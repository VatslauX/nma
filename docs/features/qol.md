## Localization

Mod has been translated and fully supports English, German and Russian localization. If you want to help us with localization to your own native language - contacts us via discord.

## Spain question

In our humble opinion Spain rework (focuses, new civil war mechanics, etc) was a good idea with bad implementation, so we’ve rollbacked those changes back to 1.8. In other words - good old Spain with a generic focus tree and generic civil war mechanic.

## General Improvements

We think that having any graphical mod is a matter of personal preference so we didn’t integrate any, instead we made a lot of QoL improvements!
For a full list of changes better check [full changelog]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/changelogs/index.md %}).

In a nutshell:

- Removed a lot of meme & anti-historical decisions, focuses, events, operative’s missions.
- Removed a lot of unplayable countries & their claims.
- Added topbar resource panel (all credits to Lennard and his HFU mod)
- United China
- Integrated More Units Levels mod, which basically makes units’ levels more smoother: you’re not going to lose those 25% of bonus damage just by adding a few arty bats into your division’s template. 
- Generals are no longer get sick, but could get wounded
- Maximum training manpower in deployment has been increased to 500 000.
- Transport planes are free to use

- South American countries (except Brazil) now has national spirit “Moderate neutrality” which prevent them from being justified, reduces their manpower by 100% and reduces their desire to join or create a faction by 100%
- ...and many, many more!

## GEACPS Naval Invasions

In order to make Japan a bit more important to the general gameplay we’ve decide to adjust naval invasion mechanics for the members of GEACPS. If Allies aren’t garrisoning the islands from the next strategic regions:

- Solomon Sea
- Arafura Sea
- Java Sea
- Eastern Micronesia
- Hawaii Ridge
- Sunda Islands
- Borneo
- Philippines
- New Guinea
- Pacific Line Ridge
- West Polynesia
- French Polynesia
- Sumatra

GEACPS will instantly capture the whole state if GEACPS have managed to succeed in naval invasion.
