The main goal of this mod is to provide the most stable, lag-free & exploit-free multiplayer experience under historical ruleset.

We didn’t test the mod’s compatibility with single player (and we’ll not in the future), so better don’t even try it in SP.

We want to give a shoutout and thanks to Thrasymachus for his enthusiasm in development of [Horstorical Multiplayer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1756277582). Horstorical Multiplayer was one of those mods which inspired us for creating our own, keep it up, mate. Additionally we want to thank our local russian HoI IV community for their specific game vision.

And the last, but not least. If you’ve encountered a bug in our mod or if you want to suggest something, please contact us in corresponding channel of our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3Xpjjrn).
